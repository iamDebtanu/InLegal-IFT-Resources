# Instruction-Fine-Tuned Language Model for Indian Legal Domain

This repository contains the resources for building an instruction fine-tuned language model specifically for the Indian legal domain. It includes datasets, pre-trained models, and other relevant resources that can be useful in training and fine-tuning a language model to understand and generate legal text in the context of Indian law.
